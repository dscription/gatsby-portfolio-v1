      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        I am a personal trainer and visual artist turned software engineer. As a
        trainer I have spent countless hours working with people on a personal
        level helping them create lasting change in their lives. I am passionate
        about the intersection between human movement, creative expression, and
        technology. This experience has taught me to be empathetic, curious, and
        persistent when it comes to finding solutions to complex problems. I
        strive to create products and experiences that bring people together.
